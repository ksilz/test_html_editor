# test_html_editor

This is project to test how to get the Flutter plugin
[html_enditor_enhanced](https://github. com/tneotia/html-editor-enhanced) to work properly in iOS. Originally 
created for issue [#226](https://github.com/tneotia/html-editor-enhanced/issues/226), it now serves as
the sample for [#227](https://github.com/tneotia/html-editor-enhanced/issues/227).
